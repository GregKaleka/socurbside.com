curbside_instructions: We are currently offering curbside pick-up or home delivery!
  How does that work? First and foremost – if you are showing signs of sickness, curbside
  pick-up is not for you! If you are unable or reluctant to leave your house at this
  time that’s ok too! Your best bet is to call us at 541-488-0029 and have your book
  delivered to your house or mailed free of charge.
